## üöÄ Setup and Installation

This project is a single-file web application and does not require a complex build process. To run it locally, you can use a simple local server.

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    git clone [your-repository-url]
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd symptomap-ai
    ```

3.  **Start a local server.**
    If you have Python installed, you can run:
    ```bash
    # For Python 3
    python -m http.server
    ```
    Or, if you have Node.js, you can use a package like `live-server`:
    ```bash
    npx live-server
    ```

4.  **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the address provided by your local server).

**üîë Note on API Key:** To use the AI features, you will need a Google Gemini API key. The code expects this key to be available. For local development, you can paste your key into the `apiKey` constant within the `<script type="module">` tag. For deployment, it is strongly recommended to use a more secure method, such as environment variables or a backend proxy.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment

This static site can be deployed to any modern web hosting service that supports static files, such as GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

### Deploying with GitHub Pages

1.  Push your code to a GitHub repository.
2.  In your repository's **Settings**, navigate to the **Pages** section.
3.  Under **Build and deployment**, select **Deploy from a branch**.
4.  Choose the `main` branch and the `/ (root)` folder, then click **Save**.
5.  Your site will be deployed to `https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repository-name>/`.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning:** Deploying to GitHub Pages will expose your API key if it is hardcoded in the HTML file. For a secure deployment, it is highly recommended to use a service like Netlify or Vercel that supports environment variables and serverless functions to protect your API key.
